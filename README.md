# KOMETA aka MOKETA

![All](https://github.com/inpudiy/KOMETA/blob/main/image/gallery/all.png)

KOMETA is a split keyboard built around Choc switches, designed for wireless operation with Pro Micro–sized microcontrollers. Its key feature is a mid-mount, hot-swappablecontroller design. To enable this, the PCB includes a USB-C port cutout, ensuring compatibility with popular wireless boards like: nice!nano or SuperMini

[Build Guide](https://github.com/inpudiy/KOMETA/blob/main/doc/buildguide.md) - [ZMK Firmware](https://github.com/inpudiy/kometa-zmk/releases)


## Features

- Pro Micro-format microcontroller, compatible with mid-mount hot-swap installation
- Optimized for wireless: hardware power switch, reset button, battery solder pads, no LEDs, and ZMK firmware
- Choc V1/V2 switches with MX spacing (19 × 19 mm)
- 42-key layout with column stagger, inspired by the Jian keyboard 
- 3D-printed case
